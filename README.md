# Responsive website
##Â A homage to TNW
This is an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

The mission is to build a responsive website, i.e. one that resizes automatically with the page.  To practice this, the [TNW Website](https://thenextweb.com) is used as a model.  All images etc are copyright to TNW.
